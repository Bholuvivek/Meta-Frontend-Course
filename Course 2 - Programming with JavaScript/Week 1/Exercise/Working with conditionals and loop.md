/**Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will create the code for a for loop, using the counter variable named i starting from 1.

To make the counter increment by 1 on each loop, you will use i++.

The exit condition for the for loop should match the output given below. 

Inside the loop, write an if-else statement, which will check the following conditions:

First, it will check if the value of i is 1. If it is, your code will console log the string "Gold medal".

Next, I will check if the value of i is 2. If it is, your code will console log the string "Silver medal".

Then, your code will check if the value of i is 3. If it is, it will console log the string "Bronze medal".

For all the remaining values of i, your code will console log just the value of i.

Note: The expected console log of the entire code should be as follows.
Gold medal
Silver medal
Bronze medal

// Code
var i;
for(i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    if (i == 1){
        console.log("Gold medal")
    }
    else if(i == 2){
        console.log("Silver medal")
    }
    else if(i == 3){
        console.log("Bronze medal")
    }
    else{
        console.log(i)
    }
}

/**Exercise 2.
 Use the completed code from the previous task, but convert the conditionals to a switch statement.
When you code the solution, the output in the console should remain exactly the same as in the previous question.

Note: You'll need three separate cases for the three medals, and a default case for all other values of the i variable
